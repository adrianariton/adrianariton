# GSoC 2023 Matplotlib Bivariate ColorMap Proposal

My name is **Adrian Ariton**, I am a first year student at **Politehnica University of Bucharest** and I am interested in the following Matplotlib project: Bivariate Color Maps.

## About myself

My main passions are maths and data-structures, and I am a curious person that enjoys learning from anything. On the technical side, I am quite experienced in mathematical concepts such as linear algebra and complex analysis, as well as numerical and symbolic programming. 

I have also won awards in both fields in olympiads and contests, such as: 1st place nationally at Romanian National Olympiad, Winner of Swift Student Challenge 2022, SEEMOUS Silver Medal and a few Hackaton prizes which can be found on my LinkedIn[1]. 

On my GitHub page one can find projects such as: 

Hephaestus++ : a c++ math library with 100digit calculation precision and tensor and Einstein notation implementations as well as basic simbolic math [https://github.com/adrianariton/hephaestus]
QAMG : a collaborative project with 3 other colleagues that implements basic Quantum Arithmetic Gates and Single Z and X-cubit Surface Codes, using both the Quantum Fourier transform as well as classical bit logic [https://github.com/adrianariton/qamg]

## Project Plan

My plan goes as follows:
- Implement Circular color maps [phase/amplitude], both discrete and continuous
- Square Color maps [real/imaginary part]
- Diverging and Sequential Color Legends and Maps (parametrised)
- Block Sphere Color Maps - could use in quantum vector plotting
- Surface Lines option for continuous colormap plots
- Maps as non-periodical complex functions
- Templates
